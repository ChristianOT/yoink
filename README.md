# Adaptive QM/MM

Multi-scale Modeling is an interesting area of Computational Science.
A large number of important systems can be studied using hybrid methods.

One of the challenges in this area is to switch representation on-the-fly.
Partitioning of the system is followed by smoothening of the buffer region.
Yoink is a framework that contains many of the published solutions.
