# Adaptive QM/MM

Multi-scale Modeling is an interesting area of Computational Science.A large number of important systems can be studied using hybrid methods. One of the challenges in this area is to switch representation on-the-fly.
Partitioning of the system is followed by smoothening of the buffer region.

Yoink is exponent framework that contains many of the published solutions.
