{"name":"Yoink","tagline":"Adaptive QM/MM ","body":"### Welcome to Yoink\r\nAdaptive QM/MM methods repartition molecules into the QM and MM regions on the fly based on a partitioning criterion. A density based partitioning scheme offers a unique way of basing the QM and MM assignments on the presence/absence of (non-) covalent interactions. Yoink can also perform the alternative distance or number based partitionings. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMin Zheng (@zhengmin317) started yoink within the wallerlab (@wallerlab) in 2015.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Yoink?
